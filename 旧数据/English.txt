As is revealed in the pie chart, people of different age vary greatly in terms of online shoping. Based upon the data of the chart, one can see that those over the age of  50 are at the lowest end, merely 6%. In contrast, however, 25-to-35-year-olds are the most active online shoppers among  the four age groups, accounting for 65%.
The contributing factors for this phenomenon are to be introduced as follows. At the top of the list, this situation stems largely from the younger workers' outlook upon comsurmation. Accounting to a recently Internet qusitionnaire, the overwhelming majority of the respondents see net perchases as a blessing since they compared to traditional retail consumption partterns, are cheaper and more convenient. Moreover, it must be admitted that this condition stems from their inadequate of income and addiction to those surfing in cyberspace. The final point that I'd like to highlight here is the young wage-earners quick-tempoed life.
Considering the arguments above, we may reasonably conclude that it is of no surprise to see this phenomenon in our hi-tech society. But I am quite centain that online shopping with development of science and technology, will become increasingly popular with consumers of different ages in the high-tech era.
